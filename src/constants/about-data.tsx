        "<div>I was born and raised in San Jose California! I grew up in the heart of <strong>Silicon Valley</strong>, though I never thought I’d end up in tech. As a kid, I just wanted to be outside - not fiddling with the family computer.</div><br/><div>That all changed though when I went to <strong>UC Santa Cruz</strong> and took a mandatory Python class. It was there something clicked and I discovered my passion for web and app development.</div><br/><div>Though I didn’t realize at the time, that class ended up being the turning point that set me on the path to becoming a <strong>Business Owner</strong> and <strong>UX engineer</strong>.</div>",

While we didn’t get the chance to fully launch, the journey taught me invaluable skills in <strong>business management</strong>, <strong>marketing</strong>, <strong>research</strong>, and—of course—<strong>development</strong> and <strong>design</strong>.</div> <br/> <div> These experiences have given me the confidence to pursue any future project, and I’m excited for the next challenge that comes my way! </div>",

        "<div>Becoming a UX Engineer wasn’t exactly part of the plan. Again, I didn’t even start coding until my first year of college! Yet I love how development lets me bring my ideas to life.</div> <br/><div> I was able to network my way into a <strong>UX Engineer role at Cisco</strong> after a few summers as a Business Analyst Intern. It was here I was able to  hone my skills in full stack rapid prototyping with an emphasis on the <strong>front-end development</strong>, particularly in <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>React</strong>. </div>",

        "<div>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me getting creative in one way or another.</div> <br/><div> I love <strong>exploring different art forms</strong>—gouache painting, ceramic tiles and pots, and more recently, digital art through pixel art and 3D modeling.</div><br/> <div> My artistic side has always influenced the way I approach my work. Through a lot of self-teaching (thanks to online courses and <strong>personal projects</strong>), I’ve developed a strong eye for design. Working as a UX engineer has given me even more insight into how great design teams work and what makes a platform truly shine.</div>",
